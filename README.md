# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML

DATASET: Hours and Scores Database

DESCRIPTION:
I explored the fascinating world of supervised machine learning by using linear regression to predict students' total marks based on their study hours. To train and test the model, I utilized the dataset found at [bit.ly/w-data]. Utilizing powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, I meticulously walked through each step of the process. First, I loaded and analyzed the dataset with Pandas to understand the relationship between study hours and total marks. Next, I employed Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data, using scatter plots to reveal patterns and correlations. Building and training a linear regression model with Scikit-learn followed, where the model learned the best-fit line for accurate predictions. Finally, I applied the trained model to predict marks for new data points and evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
